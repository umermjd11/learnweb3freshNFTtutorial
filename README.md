# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

to execute the script
'''
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/contracts
npx hardhat compile
npm install dotenv
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
